# Hot Tab

Hot Tab is a Chrome extension to help you keep tab of your tabs.

## Which problem does Hot Tab address?

When you work a lot in Chrome, you may find yourself in a situation where you continuously open tabs and need to jump back and forth between them.
Maybe because you're doing research for a document, reading various web pages and taking notes intermittently.
Or maybe you're collaborating on a chat and sift through links.

If that sounds familiar to you, you might also know how tedious it can be to even just find the right tab when you have amassed a greater number of tabs, maybe even windows, maybe even separated on different desktops.
Hot Tab tries to make that switching easier.

## How does Hot Tab attempt to solve that problem?

Hot Tab lets you pin your open tabs and associate them with a key on your keyboard.

Now if you need to get to a previously pinned tab, it's just a shortcut plus a press of the associated key away.

## Usage

* On `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`, pick a shortcut to activate the extension. This will be the key combination you'll have to press everytime you'd like to pin or retrieve a tab.

* I also recommend you pin the extension in your Chrome. That will make the Hot Tab popup appear more quickly and allow for a quicker workflow.

* If you'd like to pin the tab, press `<shortcut>` (the extension popup should appear) followed by `<Ctrl>` + `<key>`.

* If you'd like to go back to a previously pinned tab, press `<shortcut>` followed by `<key>`.

* If you'd like to move a previously pinned tab to the current window and make it the active tab, then press `<shortcut>` followed by `<Shift>` + `<key>`.
